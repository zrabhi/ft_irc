• Scokets:a way to speak to other programs using standard Unix file descriptors.

• Send and recv function offer much greater control over  yout data transmission


• What is connection: A relationship between two machines, where two pieces of software know about each other.
                    Those two pieces of software know how to communicate with each other. 
                    In other words, they know how to send bits to each other. 
                    A socket connection means the two machines have information about each other, including network location (IP address) and TCP port. 
                    (If we can use an analogy, IP address is the phone number and the TCP port is the extension). 
• AF_INET and AF_INET6: AF_INET and AF_INET6 (internet domain) sockets provide a means of communicating between application programs 
        that are on different systems using the TCP and UDP transport protocols provided by a TCP/IP product 

fucntion for the client:
• connect function will wait 75 seconds for server to respond.
• retunrs 0 if successful or SOCKET_ERROR if not.
